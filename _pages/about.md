I'm a MS CS graduate student at The University of California, Davis. I recently worked at TikTok in the Shopping Ads (Vertical Solutions) team. Previously, I was working at Swiggy as a Software Dev Engineer-I in the CRM team. Prior to that, I was working as a software engineer at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. I have avid interest in full-stack web development, backend engineering, and distributed systems.
