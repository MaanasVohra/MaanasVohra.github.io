I'm a MS CS graduate student at The University of California, Davis. Previously, I was working at Swiggy as a Software Dev Engineer-I in the CRM team. Prior to that, I was working as a software engineer at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. I have avid interest in full-stack web development, backend engineering, and distributed systems, and I dabble with code and jupyter notebooks in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. In my free time, I listen to podcasts, watch The Office and play CS GO, in no particular order.

Feel free to reach out to me and explore the website. May the force be with you!
